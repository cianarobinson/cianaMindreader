      <h1> Reading People Minds </h1>
      <p> For some odd reason ever since I was old enough to know what a super power was I've always said I wanna be able to read peoples minds. No matter how many years have pasted I always had the same answer each and every time its just something about knowing what people have on there mind. I find the thought of being in somebody head very fascinating and since im a very shy person I wouldnt ask what you are thinking about or how you feel.Just how I know I be having things on my mind other people do too so I would wanna know exactly how someone feels or thinks without having to ask. Like I said I've had this super power in my head for a while now so I've had time to think of the pros and cons to being able to read peoples thoughts and how they feel. Of couse I may not like some of the things people are thinking or certain feeling toward things and situations but , I can control it and learn how to cope with it . I've also said that I wanna be able to pick and choose who mind I'm reading and I can stop at any giving moment so I really gave it some thought.I can also use my powers as like a business people can pay me to read people minds or they own if they don't believe me that could be a quick way to make money charge by the hour. </p>
